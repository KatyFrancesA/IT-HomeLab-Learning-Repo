# USB Enclosure Selection Guide

## Goal

To select a reliable and affordable USB enclosure for the chosen M.2 NVMe SSD (Kioxia Exceria Plus G3 1TB, standard 2280 height), ensuring compatibility with a USB 3.2 Gen 1 (5Gbps) host port while providing 10Gbps capability for potential future use.

## Key Requirements

*   SSD Compatibility: M.2 NVMe (M-Key or B+M Key), 2280 size.
*   External Interface: USB 3.2 Gen 2 (10Gbps) preferred.
*   Chipset: Reliable NVMe bridge chip (e.g., Realtek RTL9210B).
*   Cooling: Aluminum casing for passive heat dissipation. Thermal pads included.
*   Cables: Must include a USB-C to USB-A cable for connection to the host PC. USB-C to USB-C cable desirable for future use.
*   Features: UASP and Trim support beneficial.

## Options Considered

1.  **UGREEN 10Gbps M.2 NVMe Enclosure**
    *   *Price:* £23
    *   *Features:* Reputable brand, Aluminum case, 10Gbps, Typically uses RTL9210B, Includes USB-C to C and USB-C to A cables.
    *   *Verdict:* Solid choice, meets all requirements, slightly higher price.

2.  **Sabrent USB 3.2 Tool-Free NVMe/SATA Enclosure**
    *   *Price:* £28
    *   *Features:* Reputable brand, Tool-free, Aluminum case, 10Gbps, Supports NVMe & SATA. **Only includes USB-C to C cable.**
    *   *Verdict:* Eliminated due to missing required USB-C to A cable and higher price.

3.  **ORICO M.2 NVMe/SATA Enclosure**
    *   *Price:* £21
    *   *Features:* Aluminum case, 10Gbps, Includes "cooling vest". Cable inclusion uncertain from initial notes. Supports NVMe & SATA.
    *   *Verdict:* Potentially good value, but uncertainty over included cables made it less appealing.

4.  **SSK Aluminum M.2 NVMe/SATA Enclosure (SHE-C325)**
    *   *Price:* £16
    *   *Features:* **Lowest price.** Aluminum case, 10Gbps, Explicitly mentions **Realtek RTL9210B** chipset, Supports NVMe & SATA, **Includes both USB-C to C and USB-C to A cables**, Includes thermal pads & screwdriver, Supports UASP & Trim.
    *   *Verdict:* **Selected.**

## Reasoning for Final Choice (SSK SHE-C325)

The SSK enclosure (Model SHE-C325) offered the best combination of features, confirmed specifications, included accessories, and price.

*   It explicitly mentions the reliable Realtek RTL9210B chipset.
*   It meets the 10Gbps speed requirement.
*   Crucially, it includes **both** the necessary USB-C to USB-A cable for current use and a USB-C to USB-C cable for future compatibility.
*   It includes thermal pads for cooling.
*   It supports UASP and Trim protocols.
*   It was the most affordable option considered.

This combination made it the clear best-value choice for housing the Kioxia G3 SSD for the external VM lab.
